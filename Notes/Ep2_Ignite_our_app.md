# Part 1
 - Push the code to GitHub repository.
 - `git init` -> Will make our project to git repo, with master branch.
 - `git branch -M main` -> Will make `main` as the main branch.
 - `git add .` -> Stages the changes in the current directory.
 - `git commit -m "Episode One"` -> Committing the code.
 - _TODO:_ Learn the difference between `git` and `github`.
 - `git add remote` -> Copy paste from github (__Akshay__ recommends not to just copy paste, do it manually).
 - `git push origin main` -> Push the code to remote.
 - Keeping pushing code to Git

> Let's Ignite our app

 - Is the code written so far is ready to push to prd?
 - What's the issue in this code?
 - It's not an optimized code.
 - No comments, no logs.
 - We need to bundle / Compress files
 - Need to optimize images.
 - Need to do lot of processing before pushing code to production.

 - Will react itself do a fast production ready app?
	 - No
	 - There are lot of other packages there to make our app production ready
	 - React is not the only thing which makes our app fast
	 - How to get those apps to the project
 - NPM
	 - Not "Node Package Manager"
	 - But is it just a Package Manager
	 - NPM does not have a full form
	 - NPM just manages packages
	 - Standard repository for all packages
	 - create react app has the npm ready with it
- npm init
	- Don't use -y 
	- It will ask few questions
	- Provide details
		- package name: namaste-react
		- version: 1.0.0
		- description: This is Namaste React by Akshay Saini
		- entry point: App.js
		- test command: jest
		- git repository: `<url>`
		- keyword: react, namaste react, akshay saini
		- author: Akshay Saini
		- license: (ISC)
	- It will show the json and ask whether the details are fine
- Now we will see pacakge.json
	- A config for our npm
	- Nothing but a json file
	- Why do we need?
		- It manages all the packages that are installed
		- These packages are also called dependencies
		- Takes care of version of dependencies
- Let's get the packages into our project
- Start installing the dependencies
- Most important package -> Bundler
	- Whole code needs to be cached, bundles, cleaned
	- Bundler takes care of it
- Webpack, Parcel, Vite are some eg of bundler.
- Packages the project, so that it can be pushed to production
- Create React App behind the scene uses webpack
